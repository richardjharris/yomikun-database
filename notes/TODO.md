## Current task

Add people back to the database!

 - remove top5k, make top5k table instead
 - add back birth years etc.
 - make_final_db should output data which has the format [table, {column: value, ...}]
   then the data loader can split stuff by table and load them seperately

Enable compression: gzipping the sqlite file shrinks it from 45M or 13M
 - bz2 and xz are even better
 - size is comparable to the gzipped JSONL, and faster to load.
 - Android asset stuff does this for you

Removing indexes helps a bit (10M less uncompressed) but would prevent us
from using the database as read-only, which is currently required for web.
On the other hand, a web version would probably use an API for the database
anyway.

### Romaji key

>>> romaji_key('ōue')
'oe'
>>> romaji_key('ooue')
'oue'

...so perhaps we should change a ōu sequence to oou.


There are a handful of counter cases where we guessed
incorrectly:

{"kaki": "周防 正行", "yomi": [-"すお-]{+"すおう+} まさゆき", "authenticity": "real", "lifetime": {"birth_year": 1956, "death_year": null}, "source": "wikipedia_en:Masayuki Suo", }

すお is a valid reading for the surname, but rare enough that we assumed
the longer one. The Wikipedia JA fixes this so one valid solution would
be to ignore entries where we have a JA article

{"kaki": "大植 英次", "yomi": [-"おおうえ-]{+"おおえ+} えいじ", "authenticity": "real", "lifetime": {"birth_year": 1957, "death_year": null}, "source": "wikipedia_en:Eiji Oue", , "notes": "Conductor"}

姓:周防（すおう、すお、すほう）は日本人の姓の一つ。

For this one, the romajidb shows:

大植    oue     sei     おおうえ        おおうえ
大植    oe      sei     おおえ  おおえ

The written name is actually 'Ōue Eiji' so expanding the macron
into 'oo' might help.

We could detect this at dedupe perhaps. Would be a little tricky. But otherwise we may overcount a bit.

# Also (app)
 - kanji with most kana
 - kana with most kanji
 - relative to total (e.g. names with readings/kanji that account for 50% or something)
 - ignoring '0' results

## Use the Researchmap code in all importers

ENwiki, wikidata etc. should use the same Researchmap code that already
handles clever stuff.

 namedata, err = intuit_name_data(kana, kanji, romaji)

{"kaki": "奥田 教介", "yomi": "おくだ きょすけ", "authenticity": "real", "lifetime": {"birth_year": 1994, "death_year": null}, "source": "wikidata:http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q106392717", "tags": ["xx-romaji", "masc", "person"]}

^ this for example.

### Related: make romaji_to_hiragana_fullname swap names for you

This would simplify logic in both researchmap and wikidata_nokana.

### koujien

Fails to split in some places, could be fixed by using RomajiDB

### Kentaro

 {{nihongo|'''Kentaro Shiga'''|志賀 賢太郎|Shiga Kentaro}}

 ^ we currently do a reverse hack for this
 - researchmap code would negate the need for it.

### oya? should be ooya.

jsonl/wikipedia_en.jsonl:{"kaki": "大矢 歩", "yomi": "おや あゆみ", "authenticity": "real", "lifetime": {"birth_year": 1994, "death_year": null}, "subreadings": [], "source": "wikipedia_en:Ayumi Oya", "tags": ["xx-romaji", "fem"]}
5	ohyama, 大山 - failed to convert? similarly kohyama 神山

### Kota Ohashi

- 'Kota Ohashi' was おはし　こた. Should be  おおはし　こうた.
- Recently おおあし こた ... that's not any better !!
  - database shows 587 hits of oohashi, 11 ooashi, 1 ouhashi
  - so slightly misleading but not a huge deal
  - they are all for 大橋, so we could override it.

- This is hard to fix, but we're definitely doing something wrong with
  ohashi here.

## Minor issues with 'notes'

{"kaki": "広瀬 茂男", "yomi": "ひろせ しげお", "authenticity": "real", "lifetime": {"birth_year": 1947, "death_year": null}, "source": "wikipedia_en:Shigeo Hirose", "tags": ["xx-romaji", "masc", "person"], "notes": "Pioneer of robotics technology BBC NEWS | In pictures: Robot menagerie, Robot lab    and a professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology"}
{"kaki": "垣越 建伸", "yomi": "かきこし けんしん", "authenticity": "real", "lifetime": {"birth_year": 2000, "death_year": null}, "source": "wikipedia_en:Kenshin Kakikoshi", "tags": ["xx-romaji", "masc", "person"], "notes": "People|Japanese] professional [baseball pitcher for the Chunichi Dragons of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB)"}

Could be fixed by making custom.csv preferred, and defining proper notes there.
Would also solve the xx-romaji issue.
Speaking of, we can definitely remove xx-romaji if we find matching non-xx-romaji entries
for the same person.
