Born '''Isamu Yamada''' (山田勇 ''Yamada Isamu'') in [[Kobe]], he adopted his current stage name while directing the ''Manga Trio'' [[manzai]] troupe from 1959 to 1968. Following his comedy years, he went into the construction industry and served as a director at several major construction firms in the [[Kansai]] region.

He became governor of [[Osaka prefecture]] in 1995, running as an independent and joining the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) after his election. He enjoyed great popularity as governor, mostly due to his existing fame as a comedian.

In 2000, a 21-year-old campaign volunteer accused Yokoyama of [[sexual harassment]], claiming that the governor groped her for 30 minutes in the back of a campaign truck. Yokoyama denied the charges, but the Osaka District Court found him liable for ¥11 million in damages, following a highly publicized trial in which the plaintiff testified from behind an opaque screen to avoid revealing her identity. Following the judgment, Yokoyama resigned: he was replaced by a female LDP bureaucrat, [[Fusae Ohta]].
