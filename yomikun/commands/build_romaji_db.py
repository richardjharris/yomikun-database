    Build RomajiDB from JSONL data

    RomajiDB is for helping convert ambiguous romaji (such as Goto Yuusuke
    rather than Gotou Yuusuke) into kana using the kanji as a hint.

    We take all the JSON data, except those tagged with xx-romaji (which were
    themselves generated from ambiguous romaji, so we don't accidentally
    create a feedback loop). Then generate a mapping of (kanji, romaji_key, mei/sei) -> (kana)

    In most cases there is a clearly obvious choice, in some cases there may be
    multiple viable choices, in which case we do not create an entry at all.
