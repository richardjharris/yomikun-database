"""
Builds a gender database from incoming NameData objects and
the data/name_lists.json data from wikipedia.

# Objectives

To be able to answer questions like:

 * given a kanji or kana given name, what is the likely gender?
 * what are the most unisex names?
 * what kanji versions of a particular kana name are most often
   associated with men or women?

For improving our data:

 * what names have zero or very few gender-tagged results?

# Ideas

 - Improve male tagging - 男優 etc. Categories should override
   anything else.

 - Using tagged data find the most common kanji for male/female names.

 - For each first name in wikipedia_ja (for example) try to compute
   the gender.

    Resources: data/name_lists.json (reading)
               average gender for kana reading
               average gender for kanji reading (*)
               guess based on kanji inside
               guess based on name length (4+ is usually male)
               manual overrides

    For cross checking: baby names site, namegen, JA wikipedia pages

    We can then compute a name dictionary which can be looked up
    independently of everything else.

    Where the results differ from reality, we tweak the algorithm.
