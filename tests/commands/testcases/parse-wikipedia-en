While in college, he developed an interest in [[manga]], which led him to create his own complete work, ''[[Black Magic M-66|Black Magic]]'', which was published in the manga [[dōjinshi]] ''Atlas''. His work caught the eye of [[Seishinsha]] President Harumichi Aoki, who offered to publish him.\n\nThe result was best-selling<ref>[[Helen McCarthy|McCarthy, Helen]]. ''500 Essential Anime Movies: The Ultimate Guide''. — Harper Design, 2009. — P. 42. — 528 p. — {{ISBN|978-0061474507}}</ref> manga ''[[Appleseed (manga)|Appleseed]]'', a full volume of densely plotted drama taking place in an ambiguous future. The story was a sensation, and won the 1986 [[Seiun Award]] for Best Manga. After a professional reprint of ''[[Black Magic M-66|Black Magic]]'' and a second volume of ''Appleseed'', he released ''[[Dominion (manga)|Dominion]]'' in 1986. Two more volumes of ''Appleseed'' followed before he began work on ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]''.\n\nIn 2007, he collaborated again with [[Production I.G]] to co-create the original concept for the anime television series ''[[Ghost Hound]]'', Production I.G's 20th anniversary project. A further original collaboration with [[Production I.G]] began airing in April 2008, titled ''[[Real Drive]]''.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Manga===\n\n{{nihongo|''Dominion''|ドミニオン|Dominion}} series:\n# {{nihongo|''[[Dominion (manga)|Dominion]]''|ドミニオン|Dominion}} (1985–1986)\n# \"Dominion: Phantom of the Audience\" (1988), short story\n# {{nihongo|''Dominion Conflict One: No More Noise''|ドミニオンC1コンフリクト|Dominion C1 Konfurikuto}} (1995)\n\n{{Nihongo|''Ghost in the Shell''|攻殻機動隊|Kōkaku Kidōtai}} series:\n# {{Nihongo|''[[Ghost in the Shell (manga)|Ghost in the Shell]]''|攻殻機動隊|Kōkaku Kidōtai}} (1989–1990)\n#: 1.5. {{nihongo|''Ghost in the Shell 1.5: Human-Error Processor''|攻殻機動隊 HUMAN-ERROR PROCESSOR|Kōkaku Kidōtai Hyūman Erā Purosessā}} (1991–1996)\n#: 1.6. {{nihongo|''Ghost in the Shell: The Human Algorithm''|攻殻機動隊 THE HUMAN ALGORITHM|Kōkaku Kidōtai: The Human Algorithm}} (2019), with Junichi Fujisaku\n# {{nihongo|''Ghost in the Shell 2: Man-Machine Interface''|攻殻機動隊 MAN-MACHINE INTERFACE|Kōkaku Kidōtai Manmashīn Intāfēsu}} (1997)\n\nStand-alones:\n* {{nihongo|''[[Black Magic (manga)|Black Magic]]''|ブラックマジック|Burakku Majikku}} (1983)\n* {{Nihongo|''[[Appleseed (manga)|Appleseed]]''|アップルシード|Appurushīdo}} (1985–1989)\n* {{Nihongo|''Gun Dancing''|グン・ダンシング}} (1986)\n* {{Nihongo|''Pile Up''|ピル・ウプ}} (1987)\n* {{nihongo|''[[Orion (manga)|Orion]]''|仙術超攻殻オリオン|Senjutsu Chōkōkaku Orion}} (1990–1991)\n* ''Exon Depot'' (1992)\n* {{nihongo|''Neuro Hard'', or ''Neuro Hard: Planet of the Bees'', or ''Neuro Hard: Planet of the Wasps''|NEURO HARD 蜂の惑星|Neuro Hard: Hachi no Wakusei}} (1992–1994)\n* {{nihongo|''Ghost Hound: Another Side''|神霊狩 ANOTHER SIDE|Shinreigari: Another Side}} (2007–2008)\n* {{nihongo|''Real Drive''|RD 潜脳調査室|RD Sennou Chousashitsu}} (2008)\n\n===Art books===\nA substantial amount of Shirow's work has been released in [[art book]] or poster book format.
