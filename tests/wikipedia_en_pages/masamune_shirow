{{Nihongo|'''Masanori Ota'''|太田正典|Ōta Masanori|born November 23, 1961}}, better known by his [[pen name]] {{Nihongo|'''Masamune Shirow'''|士郎 正宗|Shirō Masamune}}<!--Western order as per http://web.archive.org/web/19970710050520/http://www.dhorse.com/dhonline/int/index.html -->, is a Japanese [[manga artist]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.takotech.net/mshd/shirow/ |title=MSHD: About Shirow Masamune |access-date=2009-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170724204348/http://www.takotech.net/mshd/shirow/ |archive-date=2017-07-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Shirow is best known for the manga ''[[Ghost in the Shell (manga)|Ghost in the Shell]]'', which has since been turned into three theatrical [[anime]] movies, two anime television series, an anime television movie, an anime [[Original video animation|OVA]] series, a theatrical [[live action]] movie, and several [[video game]]s.

==Life and career==
Born in the [[Hyōgo Prefecture]] capital city of [[Kobe, Hyogo|Kobe]], he studied oil painting at [[Osaka University of Arts]]. While in college, he developed an interest in [[manga]], which led him to create his own complete work, ''[[Black Magic M-66|Black Magic]]'', which was published in the manga [[dōjinshi]] ''Atlas''. His work caught the eye of [[Seishinsha]] President Harumichi Aoki, who offered to publish him.

The result was best-selling<ref>[[Helen McCarthy|McCarthy, Helen]]. ''500 Essential Anime Movies: The Ultimate Guide''. — Harper Design, 2009. — P. 42. — 528 p. — {{ISBN|978-0061474507}}</ref> manga ''[[Appleseed (manga)|Appleseed]]'', a full volume of densely plotted drama taking place in an ambiguous future. The story was a sensation, and won the 1986 [[Seiun Award]] for Best Manga. After a professional reprint of ''[[Black Magic M-66|Black Magic]]'' and a second volume of ''Appleseed'', he released ''[[Dominion (manga)|Dominion]]'' in 1986. Two more volumes of ''Appleseed'' followed before he began work on ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]''.

In 2007, he collaborated again with [[Production I.G]] to co-create the original concept for the anime television series ''[[Ghost Hound]]'', Production I.G's 20th anniversary project. A further original collaboration with [[Production I.G]] began airing in April 2008, titled ''[[Real Drive]]''.

===Galgrease===
''Galgrease'' (published in ''Uppers Magazine'', 2002) is the collected name of several erotic manga and poster books by Shirow. The name comes from the fact that the women depicted often look "greased".

The first series of ''Galgrease'' booklets included four issues each in the following settings:

* ''Wild Wet West'' ([[Wild West]]-themed)
* ''Hellhound'' ([[Horror (genre)|Horror]]-themed)
* ''Galhound'' (Near-future [[science fiction]]–themed)

The second series included another run of 12 booklets in the following worlds:

* ''Wild Wet Quest'' (A ''[[Tomb Raider]]'' or ''[[Indiana Jones]]''–style sequel to ''Wild Wet West'')
* ''Hellcat'' ([[Pirate]]-themed)
* ''Galhound 2'' (Near-future [[science fiction]]–themed)

After each regular series, there were one or more bonus poster books that revisited the existing characters and settings.
