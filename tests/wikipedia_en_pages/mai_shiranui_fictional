{{nihongo|'''Mai Shiranui'''|不知火 舞|Shiranui Mai|lead=yes}} (alternatively written しらぬい まい) is a [[fictional character]] in the ''[[Fatal Fury]]'' and ''[[The King of Fighters]]'' series of [[fighting game]]s by [[SNK]]. She has also appeared in other media of these franchises and in a number of other games since her debut in 1992's ''[[Fatal Fury 2]]'' as the first female character in an SNK fighting game. She also appears in the games' various manga and anime adaptations and plays a leading role in the [[The King of Fighters (film)|live-action film]].

In the series' canon lore, Mai is a modern-world young [[Kunoichi|female ninja]] and the granddaughter of the [[ninjutsu]] master Hanzo Shiranui, with the ability to create and control fire. She is a founding member of the King of Fighters Tournament's Women Fighters Team and is madly in love with the American fighter [[List of Fatal Fury characters#Andy Bogard|Andy Bogard]], who she self-proclaimed her fiancé, who although also appears to love her, avoids being in a committed relationship with her. Yet, she still pursues him endlessly.

Largely due to her sex appeal, Mai has become one of the most popular, recognizable and celebrated female characters of the fighting game genre, especially in Japan, China, and some other East Asian countries, often being compared to [[Capcom]]'s [[Chun-Li]]. She has also become SNK's primary sex symbol and mascot character featured in many merchandise products and representing the company in many [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] titles, in addition to licensed appearances in numerous games by other companies, as well as becoming a trendy subject of [[cosplay]] and modeling.

== Character ==
=== Characteristics and portrayal ===
According to the [[SNK]] universe's early [[Canon (fiction)|canon]], Mai Shiranui was born on January 1, 1974, though the year was later omitted due to the [[sliding timescale]] of the games.<ref name="chara" /> She is a practitioner of her family's ancient Shiranui-[[Ryū (school)|ryū]] [[ninjutsu]], the empty-handed art of ''koppo-ken'' and has also been taught additional close-combat techniques by her grandfather's friend [[judo]] master [[List of Fatal Fury characters#Jubei Yamada|Jubei Yamada]].<ref name="sa">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGHwjnvczbo DEATH BATTLE! : Chun-Li VS Mai Shiranui], ScrewAttack, 29 August 2011.</ref> Having been strictly disciplined by her grandfather from an early age, she has become a proud fighter who hates to lose.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Samurai Spirits|journal=Gals Island 3: Monthly Gemesuto April Special Issue|publisher=Shinseishiya}}</ref>

Usually relaxed, enthusiastic, uninhibited and cheerful, Mai has a charismatic, flamboyant and flirtatious personality, as well as [[Exhibitionism|exhibitionistic]]<ref>[https://issuu.com/kofuniverse/docs/revista_kof_universe ''The King of Fighters Universe: Revista Oficial'' 1], page 12.</ref> tendencies. She has been madly in love with [[Andy Bogard]], an American who studied the arts Shiranui ninjutsu with her grandfather Hanzo, since her and Andy's early teens. She is a friend of [[Joe Higashi]] and Andy's older brother, [[Terry Bogard]].<ref name="sa" /> Regarding her standard education, Mai is a bookkeeper and secretary by profession. She deeply cares for her nation's and family's traditions, including battle outfits and ceremonial clothing, as well as having learned [[Kyūdō|archery]], [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[Koto (instrument)|koto]] playing, and performing the [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] and the [[Ikebana|flower arrangement art]].<ref name="qq" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dreamcancel.com/2015/06/29/exploring-kof-xiii-dialogues-mai-and-the-shiranui-legacy/ |title=Exploring KoF XIII dialogues: Mai and the Shiranui legacy – Dream Cancel |website=Dreamcancel.com |date=2015-06-29 |access-date=2016-02-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dic.pixiv.net/a/%E4%B8%8D%E7%9F%A5%E7%81%AB%E8%88%9E|script-title=ja:不知火舞|website=ピクシブ百科事典|language=ja|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref> However, she is also fond of modern foreign things, such as American style casual fashion and [[heavy metal music]] (her favourite band being [[Pantera]]).<ref>{{Cite book|title=KOF Characters|publisher=Geibunsha|year=1998|isbn=4874654061|pages=84}}</ref><ref>''SuperGamePower'' issue 7 page 25.</ref> As a girlfriend, she is gentle, kind and enjoying cooking (especially [[osechi]] dishes) and only occasionally losing her temper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.uuu9.com/2011/201110/223138.shtml |title=要白臀还是要摇乳？ 不知火舞性感COS亮裸背 - 新闻中心 - 游久网 |website=News.uuu9.com |date=2011-10-09 |access-date=2016-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://roll.sohu.com/20110904/n318294645.shtml |title=经典游戏《拳皇》角色不知火舞诱惑Cosplay(组图)-搜狐滚动 |website=Roll.sohu.com |access-date=2016-01-01}}</ref>

Her first name, "Mai", is the Japanese word for "dance" and [[Shiranui (optical phenomenon)|her surname]] is the title of a Japanese optical phenomenon similar to [[will-o'-the-wisp]], in reference to the character's [[Pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]] abilities.

In most of the games, Mai's Japanese voice actress has been [[Akoya Sogi]] (dubbed by Sheryl Stanley in the English versions of ''[[The King of Fighters: Maximum Impact]]'' series), until she was gradually replaced by [[Ami Koshimizu]] since the 2010s. [[Kotono Mitsuishi]] voiced Mai in the ''[[Fatal Fury]]'' anime films, with English dubbings provided by Sarah Sawatsky and [[Lisa Ann Beley]], and Japanese voice actress and singer [[Megumi Hayashibara]] portrayed Mai in a series of drama CDs during the 1990s.

===Conception and overall design===
[[File:Mai Shiranui design sketches.png|thumb|left|The ''[[Fatal Fury 2]]'' Mai (lower left) and her prototype characters]]
Mai Shiranui became SNK's first female playable [[fighting game]] character upon her ''Fatal Fury'' series debut in 1992.<ref name="rg" /> SNK had originally conceived two different characters—a male ninja and a [[Japanese idol]]—for ''[[Fatal Fury 2]]'' prior to her creation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Pcmania35/pcmania#page/n59/mode/1up/ |title=PCMania 35 |access-date=2014-05-04}}</ref><ref name="ali">{{cite web|url=http://www.ali213.net/news/html/2014-3/100631.html |title=80后90后的满满回忆！拳皇系列女性角色盘点_游侠网 |website=Ali213.net |date=2014-03-31 |access-date=2016-01-01}}</ref> The ninja character's working name was just Ninja Master and he had been around 60% completed before being scrapped; his long scarf was turned into her "tails" and the female character's original name was already Mai.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.snk-corp.co.jp/snk-history/|title=SNK HISTORY {{!}} 株式会社SNK|website=SNK Japan|language=ja|access-date=2018-05-17}}</ref> Further inspiration for Mai's appearance and attributes came from a number of sources.

Mai's appearance changes only slightly through most of the ''Fatal Fury'' and ''[[King of Fighters]]'' games.

In ''Fatal Fury 2'', ''Fatal Fury Special'' (1993) and ''The King of Fighters'', Mai Shiranui wears a pair of soft-soled [[tabi]]. From ''[[Fatal Fury 3: Road to the Final Victory]]'' to ''[[Real Bout Fatal Fury]]'' (both in 1995) she wears instep guards, exposing her heels and toes. In the former, she also wears a red vest and eye shadow.

=== Gameplay ===
[[Gameplay]]-wise, Mai is known as a very quick and mobile fighter, however the tradeoff is she is dealing only limited damage with her attacks. She has been noted as the fastest yet physically weakest fighter in her first game, ''Fatal Fury 2.''<ref>''Sega Visions'' 18 (April–May 1994), page 78.</ref> In opinion of ''Super Juegos'', "despite her fragile appearance", Mai is one of the more effective contenders in ''Fatal Fury Special''.<ref>''Super Juegos'' issue 36 page 38.</ref> According to a ''[[GamePro]]'' guide to ''Fatal Fury 3'', "Mai's excellent speed and air superiority give her an advantage over some fighters, but her moves inflict little damage" and thus Mai players need to constantly keep on attacking their opponents in order to prevail.<ref>''GamePro'' 72 (July 1995), page 107.</ref> Furthermore, she might be easy to pick up play for new players, for example having been described as one of the easiest characters to master in ''Real Bout Fatal Fury'' by ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]''.<ref>''Official Sega Saturn Magazine'' 13 (page 19).</ref> In ''Dead or Alive'', Mai remains a speed type of character who is relatively easy to handle, and as such ''[[Famitsu]]'' recommended her as a good character for ''DOA'' beginners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201608/23113916.html|title=『DOA5』についに参戦！ 不知火舞のプレイインプレッション＆最速攻略|date=2016-08-23|publisher=Famitsu.com|access-date=2016-08-29}}</ref>

Mai Shiranui has first starred in ''[[Fatal Fury 2]]'' where she goes to help Andy face the new host of The King of Fighters tournament, [[Wolfgang Krauser]]. She loses to [[Laurence Blood]], who takes her captive to lure Andy.<ref name="historia">{{cite web|url=http://www.sopitas.com/594545-mai-shiranui-historia-personajes-videojuegos-snk-king-of-fighters/ |title=Una Ninja muy candente: Mai Shiranui |website=Sopitas.com |access-date=2016-06-25}}</ref> She also plays a supporting role in ''[[Fatal Fury 3: Road to the Final Victory]]'' and ''[[Real Bout Fatal Fury]]'', gathering information to help in the fight against [[Geese Howard]]{{mdash}}the criminal who killed Andy and Terry's father, Jeff Bogard.<ref name="historia" /> The following games in the series, ''[[Real Bout Fatal Fury Special]]'' (1997) and ''[[Real Bout Fatal Fury 2: The Newcomers]]'' (1998), do not contain a storyline. Mai was added to the roster of ''[[Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition]]'' (1999), a 3D remake of ''[[Fatal Fury: King of Fighters]]'' which originally did not feature Mai.

''The King of Fighters'' series tournament features Mai as a regular character participating in the annual tournaments in the Women Fighters Team (also known as the Woman Fighters Team,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/kingoffighters/KingOfFighters#page/n7/mode/1up/ |title=Arcade Game Manual: The King of Fighters Neowave by SNK and Sammy |access-date=2014-06-07}}</ref> the Fighting Gals Team,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Tips_Tricks_Volume_III_Issue_12_1996-12_LFP_US/Tips__Tricks_Volume_III_Issue_12_1996-12_LFP_US#page/n19/mode/1up/ |title=Tips & Tricks - Volume III Issue 12 (1996-12) (LFP) |date=December 1996 |access-date=2014-06-07}}</ref> and the Gorgeous Team<ref>{{cite web|author=Andres Rojas|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/preview/3507/king-of-fighters-ex-neoblood-gamecube |title=King of Fighters EX: Neoblood Preview - Preview |publisher=Nintendo World Report |date= July 20, 2001 |access-date=2014-06-24}}</ref>), which she founds in ''[[The King of Fighters '94]]'' after Andy refuses to let her enter and form a team with her. Initially, the team is composed of Mai, [[King (SNK)|King]] and [[Yuri Sakazaki]] from the ''[[Art of Fighting]]'' series, with Mai aiming to help encourage King and her fellow team members and to prove to Andy the error of his ways. In ''[[The King of Fighters '99]]'', the teams were expanded to four members, and so Mai goes to the Fatal Fury Team composed of Terry, Andy and Joe, being finally able to join the tournament in the same team as Andy. In the following tournament in ''[[The King of Fighters 2000]]'', however, Mai is asked to step out to allow [[Blue Mary]] investigate a case. Denied again, she is angered by the request and joins the Women Fighters Team again and has remained a reoccurring member ever since. In the various team endings, she is often celebrating the team's victory at King's bar or fantasizing about Andy.

Mai eventually leaves the KOF tournament competitions in ''[[The King of Fighters XI]]'' (2005) to search for Andy who was absent in ''[[The King of Fighters 2003]]'' (she appears in ''KOF XI'' only as an [[Unlockable (gaming)|unlockable]] character in the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] version).<ref>{{cite web|last=Kalata |first=Kurt |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2006/07/17/the-king-of-fighters-xi/ |title=The King of Fighters XI |publisher=Siliconera |date=2006-07-17 |access-date=2014-06-19}}</ref> In ''[[The King of Fighters XII]]'', Mai is completely absent from the game itself (except a mention in Andy's profile) and appears only in the tie-in manga series, even as she has been was "teased" in a trailer and official website, and has been rumored to be added through [[downloadable content|DLC]] for the home version.<ref>{{cite web|last=Des |first=Nick |url=http://www.1up.com/news/king-fighters-xii-home-characters |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130116021525/http://www.1up.com/news/king-fighters-xii-home-characters |url-status=dead |title=King of Fighters XII Home Characters Revealed: News from |website=1UP.com |date=2008-03-15 |access-date=2014-06-24 |archive-date=2013-01-16 }}</ref><ref name=legacy>Brian Ashcraft, [http://www.kotaku.com.au/2009/07/mai-tease-in-the-king-of-fighters-xii-legacy-trailer/ Mai Tease In The King Of Fighters XII Legacy Trailer], Kotaku, July 16, 2009.</ref> In ''[[The King of Fighters XIII]]'', Mai returns to the series when she feels that the KOF tournament is not complete without her and so decides to enter it along with the other two original members of ''KOF '94''{{'}}s Women's Team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.dengeki.com/elem/000/000/249/249137/index-3.html|date=2010-03-25|access-date=2010-03-25|publisher=Dengki Online|title=アッシュ編がついに完結！ 舞にユリ、キングも参戦する『KOF XIII』は夏稼働 - 電撃オンライン|language=ja}}</ref><ref>Michael Grimm, [https://www.gamesradar.com/king-of-fighters-xiii-coming-to-consoles-and-dont-worry-mai-shiranui-is-back/ King of Fighters XIII coming to consoles, and don't worry, Mai Shiranui is back], GamesRadar, July 6, 2011.</ref> She is not upset at Andy while making her choice, content to enter a tournament with both her and him in it once more.

Mai has made her first anime appearance in ''[[Fatal Fury 2: The New Battle]]'' (1993), where she follows Andy on his search for Krauser in Germany. She is approached and later attacked by [[Laurence Blood]], but Andy defeats him and rescues her.<ref>{{cite video |date = 1993 |title = [[Fatal Fury 2: The New Battle]]|publisher = Viz Video}}</ref> In ''[[Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture]]'' (1994), Mai is present with Terry, Andy and Joe when a girl named Sulia gives them the quest to find the Armor of Mars and stop her brother Laocorn Gaudeamus. After the villain Hauer Blitzer fails to seduce Mai, he takes her prisoner after a fight, but she is again saved by Andy. Mai then defeats her rival Panni and participates in the final battle against her childhood best friend Laocorn, which ends with Laocorn dying to save her from the god of war, [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]].<ref>{{cite video |date = 1994 |title = [[Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture]]|publisher = Viz Video}}</ref>

Mai has only a minor role in the first episode of original net animation ''[[The King of Fighters: Another Day]]'' (2005), voiced by Akoya Sogi and Sheryl Stanley, wherein she and [[Athena Asamiya]] save [[Soiree Meira]] and a little girl from a collapsing building in USA. She is more prominent in [[YouTube]] computer-animated series ''[[The King of Fighters: Destiny]]'' (2017), voiced by Ami Koshimizu. In ''KOF: Destiny'', after beating up some lecherous punks in London, Mai joins up with Yuri and King, as the leader of their new Queens Team to "let men know that women are the ones who rule the world".<ref>{{Citation|last=snkGame|title=THE KING OF FIGHTERS: DESTINY – Episode 6|date=2017-09-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxGrutKorf0}}.</ref> She quarrels with Andy when [[Benimaru]] tries to use this to seduce her,<ref>{{Citation|last=snkGame|title=THE KING OF FIGHTERS: DESTINY – Episode 8|date=2017-09-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aHRSC_LYNM}}.</ref> and joins the King of Fighters tournament hoping to face Andy in the finals.<ref>{{Citation|last=snkGame|title=THE KING OF FIGHTERS: DESTINY – Episode 11|date=2017-10-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePvIH5EXI5Y}}.</ref> Before that can happen, however, Mai and her teammates come under control of Rugal Bernstein's evil power, making them attack the Fatal Fury Team.<ref>{{Citation|last=snkGame|title=THE KING OF FIGHTERS: DESTINY – Episode 19|date=2017-12-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5wDniWZTXI}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=snkGame|title=THE KING OF FIGHTERS: DESTINY – Episode 21|date=2017-12-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riwrWl0g7Ps}}.</ref> Andy is forced to fight and defeat her,<ref>{{Citation|last=snkGame|title=THE KING OF FIGHTERS: DESTINY – Episode 22|date=2017-12-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX412igfJJU}}.</ref> after which she comes back to her senses to witness the final fight between Rugal and Kyo.<ref>{{Citation|last=snkGame|title=THE KING OF FIGHTERS: DESTINY – Episode 24|date=2018-01-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py6E47fK4RM}}.</ref>

Mai Shiranui (and other ''KOF'' characters) became especially popular among the young people in [[Hong Kong]] during the late 1990s, when their character design impacted on local youth culture, including the so-called 'MK look' that "has penetrated Hong Kong street fashion, action figures and martial arts comics".<ref>Larissa Hjorth and Dean Chan (ed.)

[[Masahiro Sakurai]], director of Nintendo's ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series, said that Mai Shiranui was not included in ''[[Super Smash Bros.

Debating the merits of [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygonal]] fighting games in 1998, ''[[Hyper (magazine)|Hyper]]'' used a question whether "Would Mai Shiranui be as bouncy in polygonal form?" as an argument "that some aspects of the 2D fighting medium cannot be replicated into 3D".<ref>''Hyper'' issue 59, page 35.</ref> Nevertheless, in a review of the 3D ''The King of Fighters: Maximum Impact'' six year later, the staff of ''Official Xbox Magazine'' opined that "Mai Shiranui's heaving bosom redesigned to fully utilise the immense funbag recreating power of the Xbox" was "exactly what the doctor ordered".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/122655/reviews/king-of-fighters-maximum-impact-maniax-review |title=King of Fighters: Maximum Impact Maniax review - CVG |date=2014-10-11 |access-date=2015-07-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011002532/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/122655/reviews/king-of-fighters-maximum-impact-maniax-review |archive-date=October 11, 2014 }}</ref> David Clayman and Jeremy Dunham from IGN applaued "a wonderful job" done redesigning the ''Maximum Impact'' characters "to the modern age", including "Mai's new shorthair look", and opining they "all look great -- and in some instances, surpass the classic designs that were established so many years ago";<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2005/07/07/king-of-fighters-maximum-impact-maniax |title=King of Fighters Maximum Impact Maniax - IGN |publisher=Uk.ign.com |access-date=2015-09-27}}</ref> meanwhile ''Hardcore Gamer'' positively noted how "Mai Shiranui's bouncy, laid-back personality [still] shows in her stance".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/hardcore-gamer-magazine-v1i2/0102_July_05_Castlevania_Curse_of_Darkness#page/n29/mode/1up/ |title=Hardcore Gamer Magazine Volume 1 Issue 2 |date=July 2005 |access-date=2014-05-04}}</ref> In 2016, GameZone's James Wynne wrote that with the inclusion of Mai, the 3D fighter "''Dead or Alive 5: Last Round'' wins our brand new award for most appropriate fighting game cross-over in history, demolishing [[Akuma (Street Fighter)|Akuma]]'s appearance in ''[[Tekken 7]]''" and the game features so far "the best looking iteration of the Mai Shiranui character".<ref>{{cite web|last=Wynne |first=James |url=http://www.gamezone.com/news/mai-shiranui-comes-to-dead-or-alive-5-last-round-in-september-3441331 |title=Mai Shiranui comes to Dead or Alive 5: Last Round in September |publisher=Gamezone.com |date=2016-07-09 |access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref> Adam Beck from ''Hardcore Gamer'' opined that as "Mai is a ninja in her own series, she seems to fit perfectly within the ''Dead or Alive'' ethos".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/07/10/mai-from-the-king-of-fighters-coming-to-dead-or-alive-5-last-round/216353/ |title=Mai from The King of Fighters Coming to Dead or Alive 5: Last Round |publisher=Hardcore Gamer |date=2016-07-10 |access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref>

The character has received mostly negative reception in regards to her film appearances. GamesRadar's Henry Gilbert commented in 2014 that ''Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture'' director [[Masami Ōbari]] "never miss[ed] a chance to fill the screen with her heaving chest" while devoting more attention to her shower segment than to the film's fight scenes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/9-far-flung-game-anime-adaptations/ |title=9 far-flung game-to-anime adaptations |publisher=GamesRadar |date=January 25, 2013|access-date=February 7, 2014|first=Henry |last=Gilbert}}</ref> In ''The Complete Anime Guide'', Trish Ledoux noted that "the animation of modern-day ninja girl Mai Shiranui gave an all-new meaning to *bouncy* anime girls".<ref>Trish Ledoux, ''The Complete Anime Guide: Japanese Animation Film Directory and Resource Guide'', page 100.</ref> John Funk of ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' wrote that Mai's costume in the live-action ''The King of Fighters'' was "not nearly as cleavage-tacular as it needs to be" and recommended "getting some members from [[Tecmo]]'s [[Team Ninja]] as consultants".<ref>{{cite web|first=John|last= Funk |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/95352-The-King-of-Fighters-Movie-Trailer-Is-Confusing |title=The King of Fighters Movie Trailer Is Confusing |work=Escapistmagazine.com |date=October 9, 2009 |access-date=June 19, 2014}}</ref> [[Jeff Gerstmann]] of ''[[Giant Bomb]]'' remarked in 2009: "Maggie Q ... as Mai Shiranui?
