This lists stuff I don't have time to do now, but could look at in
the future.

Wikipedia EN/WikiData contribute only ~20k names each compared to
Wikipedia JA's 202k. The epwings even fewer.

## old db handling

Report + compare() use different old DBs

Does 'dict' work for surnames? in terms of hit counts.
  Example: 上門,かみじょう,s+dict

## Handle hiragana + kanakana variants

Most names (あけみ, ナオト) have kana variants recorded. Question is how we should handle
other forms of the names. Should we insert phantom records for the other names?

## Incorrect kana

We are now encoding 菅野 as "kan'no" etc., but client database needs to handle this
also.

## Missing kana names

  e.g. しぼり - no entries for kana -> kana (not even dict)
    Split and search logic should probably just inject a dict entry
    Or we could manufacture dict entries for every known reading.

## Names allowed in kanji

 data/chars_allowed_in_names

 - small kana are allowed
 - other old kana (wo, we, wi) are allowed
 - small wa is allowed
 - ゝゞ are allowed

## Did not detect honmyo

jsonl/wikipedia_ja.jsonl:{"kaki": "佐々木 孫悟空", "yomi": "ささき そんごくう", "authenticity": "real", "position": "person", "lifetime": {"birth_year": 1974, "death_year": null}, "source": "wikipedia_ja:佐々木孫悟空"}


## Fixing suo

{"kaki": "周防 正行", "yomi": [-"すお-]{+"すおう+} まさゆき", "authenticity": "real", "lifetime": {"birth_year": 1956, "death_year": null}, "source": "wikipedia_en:Masayuki Suo", }

すお is a valid reading for the surname, but rare enough that we assumed
the longer one. The Wikipedia JA fixes this so one valid solution would
be to ignore entries where we have a JA article. We could also detect this
at dedupe perhaps.

Could check how many new names we're actually getting from EN, it's possible
most of the EN articles (after dedupe) are just erroneous forms of JA articles.

## Dedupe subreadings

Person dedupe does not dedupe subreadings, it just picks the first record that
has any. It could at least check if any are being missed.

## More robust handling of 'yuhya'-type names

Currently we use a manual dictionary to correct these.

## Kanji picker (app)

A better kanji picker. Top/bottom slots, pick radical, etc.

## More robust romaji to hiragana conversion

Instead of simplifying romaji to a romaji key (which loses data)
we could generate all possible romaji forms of a word in RomajiDB
then look the form up directly.

For example 後藤(ごとう) would generate goto gotou gotoh goto (macron)
俊平（しゅんぺい） could generate shunpei, shumpei, shumpeh (?)

Could get unweildly quickly. But it allows us to use all the data
in the original romaji, e.g. if macrons are used they'll be respected.

 - this would be useful for 'りよう' and friends, where the small
   kana is large instead. But equally we could romaji_key ryo -> riyo
   to handle this.

## Importer module

A module to handle logging, execution time, validation, errors/okays
etc. would be useful here.

## Okinawan names

https://www.shurei.com/ - mostly already in

## Nagoya who's-who database

https://jahis.law.nagoya-u.ac.jp/who/search  (multiple editions)

## Wikipedia JA gender

If we compute all subcategories belonging to the root 'Japanese women' category we can match against that instead of handcrafted patterns.

## Wikipedia EN

Check for 'nihongo' template requires 3 arguments, there are some with fewer.

Uses researchmapcode, but this needs refactoring as it uses an internal method

## Wikidata EN

Uses `romaji_to_hiragana_messy`. Could use a better dictionary or use
the same logic as researchmap. This would swap names also.

## Wikipedia JA

We use 架空の for fictional characters, but 架空 by itself may be enough.

## Name lists online

Could develop a crawler + extractor for these.

## Tagging name splits

It's useful to tag anywhere we performed a manual data split, and
avoid using that data (at least in preference) when splitting again.
Frequency data is not considered when splitting.

 ... for example such entries can be ignored when building RomajiDB,
     which could be used as a hint for splitting kanji (rather than JMnedict)

 - low priority - not many false positives there

## Gender data

### JA wikipedia name pages

There are pages for genders that might provide extra dictionary data:

https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:日本語の女性名 (男性名・姓)

  日本の女性名。現代では主に「あきこ」、まれに「めいこ」と読むが、平安時代には「あきらけいこ」と読まれた。
  日本人の人名。主に女性名に使われる。
  敦子（あつこ）は、日本の女性名。

And in English:

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Japanese_unisex_given_names

Would be worth checking these.

### Wikidata gender override

wikidata is sometimes wrong about gender. We could override it if we have
enough data, e.g. wikipedia en/ja disagree with it. Currently we just take
the majority.

## Counters

 - categories (time / food / etc.)
 - rarity within category
 - implement tidy-up code and sanity checker

 https://www.benricho.org/kazu/index.html
 https://www.sanabo.com/kazoekata/

## Refactor

 - Should probably ensure only one set of subreadings exists.
 - Map names back to sources (at DB level)

## Bugs

### JA Wikipedia

# 士郎 正宗

Pen name according to wiki-en, but we reported 'real'.
To fix this we'd need to use wikidata to collect interlanguage links, to notice
that all the records are for the same person.

### EN Wikipedia

 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingo\_Tano

Born name in infobox.

## JA Wikipedia - names inside articles

Crawl for names **inside** articles (e.g. in kanji(kana) form). Most of these
are character names, but probably still useful for reading data.

## Alternate kanji forms

Names like Akira Kurosawa and many old names have multiple forms. Currently we
handle this by making duplicate records, but it would be better to tolerate common
pairings like 高・髙 (for 髙木). OTOH alt forms seem to be collocated with particular
kanji most of the time (木 in this case), so not a priority.

Could be done by the app itself.

### Weird 'しゆん', and 'りよう' entries

Fun stuff here (17 hits):

    "kaki": "京子",
    "yomi": "きようこ",
               ^
    "kaki": "純一",
    "yomi": "じゆんいち",
               ^
Oh boy...

    "kaki": "淳一",
    "yomi": "じゆんいち",
               ^
    "kaki": "亮",
    "yomi": "りよう",
               ^
From wikipedia and also researchmap:
jsonl/researchmap.jsonl:{"kaki": "吉田 亮", "yomi": "よしだ りよう", "authenticity": "real", "lifetime": {"birth_year": null, "death_year": null}, "subreadings": [], "source": "researchmap", "tags": ["person"]}
For 'ryou', 274 of these vs. 8830 total. So not too bad. But annoying.

### 井

There are a few results of 'ii' for these names, possibly because websites
reject names of 1 char in length. Maybe we should override these as ii
is not a regular reading. 伊 doesn't have this problem (although 'ihn' is
occasionally seen).

### All or nothing

Could tag individual parts of the name with xx-romaji if we had dictionary
data for some but not all?
 e.g. xx-romaji-sei, xx-romaji-mei

E.g. in researchmap.parser we attach xx-romaji to all items that use romaji.
To make this cleaner, the researchmap generator could return 2 parts instead
of one NameData record.

If we do this, change finaldb's record_hit to only apply to the particular
part.

### Use the Researchmap code in all importers

Wikidata etc. should use the same researchmap code that already
handles clever stuff.

 namedata, err = intuit_name_data(kana, kanji, romaji)

{"kaki": "奥田 教介", "yomi": "おくだ きょすけ", "authenticity": "real", "lifetime": {"birth_year": 1994, "death_year": null}, "source": "wikidata:http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q106392717", "tags": ["xx-romaji", "masc", "person"]}

^ this for example.

### Related: make romaji_to_hiragana_fullname swap names for you

This would simplify logic in both researchmap and wikidata_nokana.

## wikidata: de-dupe variant records

Somehow when removing nakaguro I stripped 300 records from wikidata.jsonl?
I think due to the seen() stuff? None of my code would have changed it, yet
the .old version has 2 copies of Q55526706

Change unique key to (Q, birth_date % 2, kanji) ?
 if kanji is not split, don't store it? or warn
 Check for unsplit people

        # * we also get dupe records with different kanji/kana combinations,
        #      only some make sense. Whoops. e.g. https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6753582
        #      has two 'name in kana', only one makes sense.
        # * we could improve this by doing all of them then outputting the 'best'
        #      e.g. the one we were able to split.
        # Dump has 143,141 unique names and 147,676 records - so not a major problem,
        # but could return incorrect readings.

Some records make no sense and could be rejected, e.g.
jsonl/wikidata.jsonl:{"kaki": "河野悠里", "yomi": "だいぜんじ ふみこ", "authenticity": "real", "lifetime": {"birth_year": 1983, "death_year": null}, "subreadings": [], "source": "wikidata:http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11554202", "tags": ["fem"]}

[**] Also need a re-run for katakana handling update.

## Wikipedia EN misc todo

-  {{nihongo}} is used for non-name stuff too. Examples include {{Nihongo|Tokyo Tower|東京タワー|Tōkyō tawā}}

- second argument is optional.
- honmyo is listed as 'born ' in the extra content.
- some are missing the fourth argument too (below)

- a few do not use {{nihongo}} but they seem very rare!

It's possible the template birth/death can be used to filter these
out.

TODO: Natsume Soseki
{{nihongo|'''Natsume Sōseki'''|夏目 漱石|extra=9 February 1867&nbsp;– 9 December 1916}}, born '''{{nihongo|Natsume Kin'nosuke|夏目 金之助}}''', was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] novelist. He is best known around the world for his novels ''[[Kokoro]]'', ''[[Botchan]]'', ''[[I Am a Cat]]'', ''[[Kusamakura (novel)|Kusamakura]]'' and his unfinished work ''[[Light and Darkness (novel)|Light and Darkness]]''. He was also a scholar of [[British literature]] and writer of [[haiku]], ''[[Kanshi (poetry)|kanshi]]'', and [[fairy tale]]s. From 1984 until 2004, his portrait appeared on the front of the Japanese [[Banknotes of the Japanese yen|1000 yen note]].

 ^ no extra argument here! oops... what a pain...

 ---

Code to handle PSEUDO ('Born ....') lines is TBD, so we don't capture the real name.

## Improving splitting

Splitting uses name_dict which internally uses JMNEdict. It could use RomajiDB
even for romaji=False, for more coverage. Example is 吉田(よしだ), missing from
jmnedict I think?

We currently match biggest surname possible. We should prefer a split that matches
both mei/sei together if available.

An example is 和田慎二 (wada shinji)
 - jmnedict matches 和田 as わだし only
 - therefore we split, but んじ is not valid?

`try_to_swap_names` could also be improved by consulting the name DB instead o
abusing split.

---

Not sure if RomajiDB has multiple readings used in find_split_point.

## Other items

 * In make_gender_dict, if we have gender-tagged entries in `dict`, we should
   consider forcing use of hits-based gender determination, or making it contribute
   more.

 * In romaji_to_hiragana_messy, we don't try to handle ē -> ei in the same way
   as o. The whole thing is hacky though, there's rarely a good reason to use this
   function!
